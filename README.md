## What is eHotels? 
eHotels is a British hotel chain that integrates efficiency, relaxation and simplicity with technology to create a unique hotel user experience. The main focus of eHotels is to allow hotel customers to request for services via an application that is installed in a tablet of each hotel room to allow stress free communication via a process most humans are used to. 

The application will allow customers to request for towels, request and organise a room service clean, order restaurant food and message the hotels eBot which answers questions such as the weather, the hotel restaurant, the best activities in the area etc. (Although the eBot is currently non intelligent, however In the future will be an AI bot). Staff members controlling the flow of data will be given their own Staff login and will be allowed to see live updates on all the services requested and the time they were requested.
